                                I came to tech a little later in life.
                                I started out in university where I acheived a Bachelor of Science in Psychology,
                                also having completed research as part of my honours in psychology. During my studies I got a job as a support worker to help pay for my tuition. 
                                It was always meant to be a stepping stone to something else. 
                                I remained in that job for around 5 years.
                            </p>
                            <p id="info2" class="about-me" style="display: none;">
                                I had originally intended to go to grad school for psychology. The brain has always interested me. 
                                Our current models of how the brain works are based a lot on computers. The signals neurons send and the differences in long term and short memory are two examples of this.
                                As it turns out, computers is where my true passion has always been. Covid-19 and life events around the same time gave me a unique opportunity to reflect on what I wanted.    
                            </p>
                            <p id="info3" class="about-me" style="display: none;">
                                I've always been interested in computers, but hadn't tried programming. After having researched potential careers I kept coming back to it. 
                                I tried it out and was hooked from the moment I changed some website's HTML to display my name on my local copy of the website. I kept learning while working as a support worker. 
                                After a month of learning on my own, it was very clear this was what I wanted to do and what I should've done from the start. Hindsight's 20/20.
                            </p>
                            <p id="info4" class="about-me" style="display: none;">
                                I applied and got into Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC). While there I've continued to learn JavaScript on my own as well as learn the following languages/technologies through my time at school:
                                HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, Figma, Java, C, C#, C++, Kotlin, Node.JS, Android Studio, Godot and Unreal Engine 5.
                            </p>
                            <p id="info5" class="about-me" style="display: none;">
                                My goal is to work as a front-end web developer, a mobile developer or, most of all, a game developer. However, until I reach that goal
                                I wish to provide as much value to companies I work at, no matter the kind of work and I strive to keep learning and doing better than I did before.<br>
