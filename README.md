# Portfolio
## General
### This was started as an assignment at NSCC but I will be maintaining it long after. It's very much a work in progress (Always will be by definition of a portfolio but is especially so, right now)
### Included in the files under pokemon-game is a game made with HTML, CSS and JS. It can be played directly in your browser, as long as your screen size is above what the canvas size is set to, it should work fine and be layed out how it's intended to be.
### The portfolio itself is made with HTML, CSS and JS. I've used bootstrap as well. 
### The projects will eventually showcase projects that display my skills with game dev. Secondarily I'll have web dev related projects. Another area of coding I've really enjoyed. 
### There hasn't been much related to coding that I haven't enjoyed, honestly. As such, I'm open to other opportunities but I'll be working towards game dev!
## RPG Monster Collector
### No idea what to call this. As of right now, I have no plans to make this an actual proper game. More a test of what I can do using the canvas element with HTML.
### It started as a project I made following a tutorial found here: 
### [Pok√©mon JavaScript Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA&t=7135s)
### I've extended the project quite a bit.
### Here's the features I added:
- A battle menu with ability to use items, attack, befriend and flee
- Recruit monsters
- Additional monsters
- Enter the player's house and room
- Completely new tileset for world
- Talk to an npc who heals you
- Pick up three different items
- Items on overworld as well as hidden
- Basic inventory management
- Basic team management
- Save the game
### Things to do:
- [x] Fixed paths to assets
- [ ] Clean up code and add comments explaining functions 
- [ ] Actual level ups (EXP can be gained but doesn't do anything)
- [ ] Create better stats for monsters and in turn related items
- [ ] Create interior maps for the other two houses
- [ ] New sprites for NPCs and more of them
- [ ] Movement for NPCs
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Complete the options for team in the menu
- [ ] \(Optional) New sprite for player
