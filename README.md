# Portfolio
## General
This was started as an assignment at NSCC but I will be maintaining it long after. It's very much a work in progress (Always will be by definition of a portfolio but is especially so, right now)
The portfolio itself is made with HTML, CSS and JS. I've used bootstrap as well. 
The projects will eventually showcase projects that display my skills with game dev. Secondarily I'll have web dev related projects. Another area of coding I've really enjoyed.
There hasn't been much related to coding that I haven't enjoyed, honestly. As such, I'm open to other opportunities but I'll be working towards game dev!
